## Known Issues & Technical Debt

### Critical Issues to Fix
1. **Multi-Tenant Architecture Implementation** (NEW - HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Status: Not started - single-tenant architecture currently
   - Issue: No company/tenant isolation - all users see all data
   - Impact: Cannot support multiple companies - critical for SaaS model
   - Fix: Implement shared database multi-tenancy with company_id isolation
     - Add companies table
     - Add company_id to all tenant tables (users, customers, tickets, invoices, inventory_items)
     - Create tenant context middleware
     - Update all services to filter by company_id
     - Update registration to create/join companies
     - Update JWT to include company_id
     - Update all queries to scope by company

2. **Role-Based Access Control Enforcement** ✅ FIXED
   - Status: ✅ RBAC middleware implemented and applied to all routes
   - ✅ Created `rbac.middleware.ts` with `requireRole`, `requireAdmin`, `requireManagerOrAdmin`, and `requireTechnicianOrAbove` functions
   - ✅ Applied RBAC to invitation, customer, ticket, and invoice routes
   - ✅ Updated all route tests to verify RBAC enforcement
   - ✅ Manager role added to UserRole type and validators
   - Note: RBAC is scoped per company (users can only access their company's data via tenant middleware)

2. **Frontend-Backend Integration Gaps**
   - Status: ✅ All core endpoints implemented and tested
   - ✅ All Ticket Endpoints Complete:
     - POST `/api/tickets/:id/assign` - Assign technician
     - POST `/api/tickets/:id/status` - Update ticket status
     - POST `/api/tickets/:id/diagnostic-notes` - Add diagnostic note
     - POST `/api/tickets/:id/repair-notes` - Add repair note
   - ✅ All Invoice Endpoints Complete:
     - POST `/api/invoices/:id/items` - Add invoice item
     - PUT `/api/invoices/:id/items/:itemId` - Update invoice item
     - DELETE `/api/invoices/:id/items/:itemId` - Remove invoice item
     - POST `/api/invoices/:id/paid` - Mark invoice as paid
     - GET `/api/customers/:id/invoices` - Get customer invoices
   - Remaining: End-to-end integration testing and RBAC enforcement

3. **Inventory Management System** ✅ COMPLETED
   - Status: ✅ Complete - Full inventory and purchase order system implemented
   - ✅ Inventory service with CRUD operations, delete validation (quantity must be 0), and quantity adjustment
   - ✅ Purchase order service with full workflow (draft -> ordered -> received/cancelled)
   - ✅ Purchase order routes with receive and cancel functionality
   - ✅ Inventory routes with full CRUD and RBAC enforcement
   - ✅ Frontend pages for inventory and purchase orders (list, detail, new, edit)
   - ✅ Support for negative quantities (backordered items) with UI indicators
   - ✅ Purchase orders update inventory quantities when received

### Code Quality Issues
1. **Frontend Testing**: No test suite for frontend components and pages
2. **Integration Testing**: End-to-end testing between frontend and backend not implemented
3. **Error Handling in Frontend**: May need improved error handling for API failures

### Architecture Decisions Needed
1. **RBAC Implementation Strategy**: Decide on permission model (role-based vs permission-based)
2. **API Versioning**: Consider if API versioning is needed (probably not for MVP)
3. **Frontend State Management**: Evaluate if Context API is sufficient or if Zustand is needed

## Risk Mitigation (Updated)

### Current Risks
1. **Multi-Tenant Architecture Not Implemented** (NEW - CRITICAL)
   - Risk: Cannot support multiple companies - blocks SaaS model entirely
   - Mitigation: Implement multi-tenancy in Week 1 before other features
   - Impact: CRITICAL - application cannot be used as SaaS without this
   - Priority: HIGHEST - must be completed before other features

2. **Data Isolation Vulnerabilities**
   - Risk: Users might access other companies' data if company_id filtering is missed
   - Mitigation: 
     - Use middleware to enforce company_id on all requests
     - Add database-level constraints (foreign keys)
     - Comprehensive testing of data isolation
     - Code review to ensure all queries include company_id
   - Impact: CRITICAL - security and compliance issue
   - Priority: HIGH - must be verified before launch

3. **Frontend-Backend Integration Gaps**
   - Risk: Some frontend features may not work due to missing endpoints or company context
   - Mitigation: Complete missing endpoints and test all integrations with company isolation
   - Impact: Medium - some features may be limited but core functionality works

4. **RBAC Not Enforced**
   - Risk: All authenticated users have same access level (within their company)
   - Mitigation: Implement RBAC middleware and apply to all routes (company-scoped)
   - Impact: High - security and compliance critical

3. **Scope Creep**
   - Risk: Temptation to add features before core is complete
   - Mitigation: Strictly follow priority order, complete backend first
   - Impact: Medium - could delay MVP

4. **Testing Debt**
   - Risk: Building features without testing
   - Mitigation: Test each service/route as it's built, use Cursor to generate test cases
   - Impact: Medium - technical debt accumulation

5. **Solo Developer Burnout**
   - Risk: Working alone can lead to burnout or loss of motivation
   - Mitigation: Set realistic daily goals, take breaks, celebrate small wins
   - Impact: High - can derail entire project

6. **AI Dependency**
   - Risk: Over-relying on Cursor without understanding code
   - Mitigation: Review AI-generated code, understand what it does, learn from patterns
   - Impact: Medium - could create maintenance issues later

## Leveraging Cursor Effectively

### Best Practices for AI-Assisted Development
1. **Pattern Matching**: Show Cursor existing code and ask it to replicate patterns
   - Example: "Create a ticket service following the same pattern as user.service.ts"
   
2. **Incremental Development**: Build one feature at a time, use Cursor to maintain consistency
   - Don't ask Cursor to build entire modules at once
   - Build, test, iterate with Cursor's help

3. **Code Review**: Use Cursor to review your own code
   - "Review this code for bugs and improvements"
   - "Check this for TypeScript type safety"
   - "Suggest refactoring improvements"

4. **Error Resolution**: When stuck, paste errors into Cursor
   - "This error occurred, what's wrong and how do I fix it?"
   - Cursor can analyze stack traces and suggest fixes

5. **Documentation**: Use Cursor to generate and maintain docs
   - "Generate API documentation for these routes"
   - "Update README with current features"

6. **Testing**: Use Cursor to generate test cases
   - "Generate test cases for this service"
   - "Create integration tests for these endpoints"

### What Cursor Excels At
- ✅ Generating boilerplate code (services, routes, components)
- ✅ Following existing patterns and conventions
- ✅ Fixing syntax errors and type issues
- ✅ Refactoring and code improvements
- ✅ Generating test cases
- ✅ Creating documentation
- ✅ Debugging and error analysis

### What Requires Your Judgment
- ⚠️ Architecture decisions (Cursor can suggest, but you decide)
- ⚠️ Business logic validation (you know the domain)
- ⚠️ User experience decisions (you understand the users)
- ⚠️ Security considerations (review AI suggestions carefully)
- ⚠️ Performance optimization (test and measure)

## Development Workflow (Solo + Cursor)

### Daily Routine
1. **Morning (15 min)**: Review previous day's work, check git status, plan today's tasks
2. **Development Sessions**: 
   - Use Cursor to generate boilerplate (services, routes)
   - Focus on one service/feature at a time
   - Ask Cursor to follow existing patterns
   - Test immediately after implementation
3. **End of Session**: Commit code with clear messages
4. **End of Day**: Update PROGRESS.md, review what was accomplished

### Weekly Routine
1. **Monday**: Review PLAN.md, set week's goals, prioritize tasks
2. **Mid-week**: Quick check-in with self, adjust if needed
3. **Friday**: Review week's progress, update documentation, plan next week

### Cursor-Specific Workflow Tips
- **Pattern Replication**: "Create a customer service similar to user.service.ts"
- **Quick Fixes**: "Fix the authentication bug in customer.routes.ts"
- **Code Generation**: "Generate CRUD routes for tickets following the customer routes pattern"
- **Refactoring**: "Refactor this code to match the existing service pattern"
- **Error Debugging**: "Analyze this error and suggest a fix"
- **Type Safety**: "Check this code for TypeScript type issues"

### Code Quality Standards
- Write TypeScript with proper types (no `any` types) - use Cursor to catch these
- Follow existing code patterns (service layer, route handlers) - ask Cursor to match patterns
- Add error handling to all async operations - Cursor can suggest error handling
- Use existing logger for all logging - Cursor can ensure consistency
- Follow RESTful API conventions - Cursor can validate
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable names
- Use Cursor's code analysis to maintain quality

### Time Management for Solo Developer
- **Pomodoro Technique**: 25-45 min focused sessions with breaks
- **Batch Similar Tasks**: Do all services, then all routes, then all frontend
- **Use Cursor for Speed**: Let AI handle repetitive boilerplate
- **Avoid Perfectionism**: Ship working code, iterate later (Cursor helps with quick iterations)
- **Set Realistic Goals**: Don't overcommit - adjust timeline based on actual progress
